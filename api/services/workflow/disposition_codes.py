"""Canonical catalog of call disposition codes.

``gathered_context.mapped_call_disposition`` is what the Disposition column
and the ``dispositionCode`` filter both read, so this module enumerates every
value the platform can write there. Keeping the list here — rather than
duplicated in the frontend — is what stops the filter dropdown from drifting
behind the code that produces the dispositions.

Three kinds of built-in value feed that field:

* the pipeline, via ``PipecatEngine.end_call_with_reason`` /
  ``set_call_disposition`` — an ``EndTaskReason`` value;
* the telephony status callback, via ``status_processor`` and
  ``mark_workflow_run_failed`` — a ``TelephonyCallStatus`` value, for calls
  that never connected;
* terminal variable extraction — one of Dograh's default business outcomes,
  such as ``do_not_call`` or ``callback_requested``.

Organizations that map dispositions to their own codes (``XFER``, ``DNC``, …)
produce values outside this catalog. Those are learned per workflow by
``add_call_disposition_code`` and merged in by
``get_organization_disposition_codes``.
